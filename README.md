# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Objective
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival.
# Dataset 
- Source : Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle
- Description : Includes information about Titanic passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
# Data Cleaning Steps
- Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked)
- Converted categorical variables to numerical representations (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
- Removed or imputed outliers
- Created new features such as FamilySize and IsAlone for better insight
- Parsed and simplified complex fields like Name (to extract titles) and Cabin
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate Analysis :
Distribution of survival rate
Age distribution by gender and class
Fare distribution across classes
- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis :
Survival rate by gender, class, and embarkation port
Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features
Boxplots and violin plots for visualizing relationships between numerical and categorical variables.
# Visualizations Used
- Histograms, bar plots, and pie charts
- Box plots and violin plots
- Heatmaps for correlation
- Pair plots for multivariate relationships
# Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
